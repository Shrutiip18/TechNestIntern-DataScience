# Data Science Internship Projects â€“ TechNestIntern
Welcome to my Data Science Internship repository. This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my internship at TechNest, focusing on real-world Data Science applications including EDA, machine learning, deep learning, model deployment, and optimization.

# Task 1: Data Pipeline Development
Built an automated ETL pipeline using the Titanic dataset. The pipeline includes steps for data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and loading using Python libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.

# Task 2: Deep Learning Project
Designed and trained an LSTM model for fake news classification using TensorFlow and Keras. Included metrics visualization, model evaluation, and interpretation of predictions.

# Task 4: Optimization Model
Solved a resource allocation problem using Linear Programming. Utilized PuLP to create an optimization model on supply chain data, delivering business insights and recommendations.

# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted a detailed EDA on the Netflix Shows dataset. Identified trends, outliers, and correlations through visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, and proposed hypotheses for modeling.

# Task 6: Model Evaluation and Tuning (Optional)
Compared multiple ML models on a student performance dataset. Evaluated models using Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

# Tech Stack
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, PuLP
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Kaggle
